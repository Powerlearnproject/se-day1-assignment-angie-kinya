#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Ans: Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and methods to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of systems. It involves the use of scientific and mathematical techniques to analyze, design, and develop software systems that meet specific requirements. It is crucial in the technology industry because it enables the development of complex software systems that can be used in various applications that make modern life easier. It also ensures that software systems are developed in a systematic and controlled manner, which reduces the risk of errors and improves the overall quality of the software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Ans: 1. Development of programming languages like C, C#, and Python. 
     2. Establishment of the software engineering discipline in the 1960s.
     3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Ans: 1. Requirements - gathering user needs and documenting them along with system   requirements.
     2. Design - creating a detailed design plan for the software architecture and user-interface.
     3. Implementation - writing and building the code for the software according to the design specifications.
     4. Testing - verifying the software works as expected and meets the functional requirements.
     5. Deployment - releasing the software to the users.
     6. Maintenance - providing ongoing support, fixing bugs, updating the software, and adding new features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Ans:  Waterfall methodology is a linear approach where each phase is completed before moving on to the next one. It is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and a fixed scope. On the other hand, agile methodology is an iterative approach where the project is divided into smaller chunks, and each chunk is completed before moving on to the next one. It is suitable for projects with changing requirements and a high degree of uncertainty.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Ans: Software Developer: responsible for designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems. They write code, debug, and ensure that the software meets the requirements.
     Quality Assurance Engineer: responsible for ensuring that the software meets the quality standards. They test the software, identify bugs, and report them to the development team.
     Project Manager: responsible for overseeing the entire project from initiation to delivery. They manage the team, resources, and timelines to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Ans: Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for software development. It includes features like code  editing, debugging, and project management. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio, Eclipse, and IntelliJ. Version Control System (VCS) is a system that helps track changes made to the code over time. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously and ensures that the code is always up-to-date . Examples of VCS include Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Ans: 1. Changing Requirements - the requirements may change during the project, which can cause delays and cost overruns. Strategy: use of agile methodologies to prioritize the requirements, and break down the project into smaller chunks.
2. Technical Debt - the code may become outdated and difficult to maintain. Strategy: use of continuous integration and continuous deployment to ensure that the code is always up-to-date.
3. Tight Deadlines - pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development. Strategy: use of project management tools to track progress, and prioritize tasks to ensure that the project is completed on time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Ans: 1. Unit Testing - this is the testing of individual components of the software.
     2. Integration Testing - this is the testing of interactions between the different components or subsystems.
     3. System Testing - this is the testing of the entire system as a whole.
     4. Acceptance Testing - this is the testing of the software to ensure that it meets the requirements and is acceptable to the end-users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Ans: Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting input prompts to acquire specific and accurate responses from AI models. It is crucial in interacting with AI models because it enables users to communicate effectively with the models, and get the desired output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Ans: Vague prompt -  "Tell me about the history of AI."
     Improved prompt - "What are the key milestones in the development of artificial intelligence from the 20th century to the present day?"
     The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific, and concise. It provides a clear direction to the AI model, and helps it to generate a more accurate and relevant response.
